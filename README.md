# Healthcare Backend

This project provides a backend for a healthcare application built with Node.js and TypeScript. It utilizes a Mongoose connection to interact with a MongoDB database for storing healthcare data. The project is secured with JWT-based authentication and authorization.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-backend.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd healthcare-backend
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Usage
Start the development server:

Bash

npm run start or nodemon index.ts
This will start the server on the port specified in the PORT environment variable (defaults to 3000).

Access the API endpoints using a tool like Postman.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

├── controllers
│   └── ... (controller files)
├── middlewares
│   └── ... (middleware files)
├── models
│   └── ... (model files)
├── routes
│   └── ... (route files)
├── services
│   └── ... (service files)
├── index.ts
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── ... (other configuration files)
controllers: This directory contains controller files that handle incoming API requests and interact with services.
middlewares: This directory contains middleware functions that are executed before requests reach controllers. They can be used for tasks like authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.
models: This directory contains Mongoose models that represent the data structures stored in the MongoDB database.
routes: This directory contains route definitions that map API endpoints to controller functions.
services: This directory contains service functions that encapsulate business logic.
Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.
TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing for improved code maintainability.
Express: Web framework for building APIs.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for interacting with MongoDB.
JWT (JSON Web Token): Secure mechanism for authentication and authorization.
